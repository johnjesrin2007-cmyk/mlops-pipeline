Legilimens-AI
Multimodal Emotion Detection & Symptom Inference System

📌 Project Overview
Legilimens-AI is an intelligent web-based system that analyzes human emotions using voice and facial expressions and further infers possible mental health symptoms based on detected emotional patterns.
The application integrates Flask, OpenCV, AI emotion models, and a structured symptom-mapping logic to provide meaningful insights into a user’s emotional and psychological state.
